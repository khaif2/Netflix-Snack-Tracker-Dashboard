🍿 Netflix & Regret + 🍕 Snack Tracker Dashboard
A 2-page Power BI dashboard analyzing my binge-watching & snack-eating habits over 3 years.

Built for fun. Powered by data. Fueled by chips. 😅

🎯 Project Idea

I wanted to learn Power BI in a fun way, so instead of using boring sales data, I tracked something more realistic:

How much Netflix I binged 📺

How many snacks I destroyed 🍟

How many hours of sleep I sacrificed 😴

Result? A hilarious 2-page dashboard that shows my life choices in charts.

🛠️ Tools Used

Power BI – to build interactive dashboards

Excel – to clean & prepare my data

GitHub – to share it with the world 🌍

Humor – to make analytics fun 🤓

Essentially, my Netflix habit comes with a side of fries 🍟.
